Welcome to the NTPsec project - a secure, hardened, and improved
implementation of Network Time Protocol derived from NTP Classic, Dave
Mills's original.

NTPsec, as its same implies, is a more secure NTP.  We employ best
practices and state-of-the art technology in code auditing,
verification, and testing to deliver code that can be used with
confidence in deployments with the most stringent security,
availability, and assurance requirements.

Our first best practice is true open-source code review.  The NTPsec
code is available in a public git repository. One of our goals is to
support broader community participation than NTP Classic's use of
the proprietary BitKeeper version-control system allowed.
