<h1>Platform support policy</h1>

<div id="content">
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Our primary development platforms are Linux and FreeBSD.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We have an actively maintained port to Mac OS X.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We expect the NTPsec code to run with at most minor port changes on
Unixlike operating systems conforming to POSIX.1-2001 and ISO/IEC
9899:1999 (aka C99). and supporting ntp_gettime(2)/ntp_adjtime(2).
Python 2.5 is also required.  We will fully support these platforms.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We intend to port to Windows, but that may not land in early releases.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Hardware with 32 or 64 bits and any endianness is supported.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>NTP Classic kept legacy support for a lot of very ancient Unix big
iron, and for other systems such as VMS.  But increasing security
requires reducing complexity and attack surface.  We have almost
completely removed legacy Unix support, and our direction is towards
dropping the remainder (along with unused or rarely-used features) in
order to achieve secure simplicity.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you are a stranded legacy user with security and reliability
requirements strong enough that only NTPsec will do, our team is open
to working with active port maintainers who will take responsibility
for specific target environments not fully conformant to the
POSIX.1-2001/C99/Python-2.5 combination, or for exotic hardware.</p></div>
