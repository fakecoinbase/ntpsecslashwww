<div class="paragraph"><p>Any software project that is as life- and mission critical as NTP
experiences a powerful tension between pressure to evolve rapidly abd
pressure to change in only very conservative ways.  On the one hand,
some users are extremely conservative and can adopt new code only
after a difficult certification procedure; others with different
tradeoffs will disqualify a project that develops too slowly
towards the capabilities they desire.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For NTPsec this tension is only increased by the fact that the NTP
Classic codebase we inherited had fallen into serious disrepair.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To resolve this tension, NTPsec will ship releases from two distinct
lines of development.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The 1.x line will be aimed at legacy users.  Security and urgent
bug fixes will be applied to it, but neither new features nor
new porting work will be.  If you have strict technical or
procedural requirements for backward compatibility, use 1.x,
but be aware of the tradeoff that it will get little or no
functional improvement and may never achieve the security
level of seriously hardened code.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The 2.x line will press forward on code hardening, functional
improvements, and new features. Some 1.x features will be
<a href="removal-plan.html">removed</a> from 2.x - this is a deliberate
choice to reduce complexity and attack surface (remember, "Perfection
is achieved &#8230; when there is nothing left to take away").</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We expect 1.x and 2.x to interoperate smoothly in normal
circumstances, but their control and monitoring tools may
diverge over time.</p></div>
