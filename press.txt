== Overview and Quick Facts ==

The NTP Security Project, or "NTPsec", is an open source project that
is security hardening and updating the widely used reference
implementation of the Network Time Protocol.

NTP is how the Internet keeps correct time, which is critically
important for cybersecurity, and is necessary for finance, cloud
computing, media streaming, data storage, email, calendaring, and for
keeping the clock on most personal computers set correctly.

NTP was invented by one of the original creators of the internet
itself, Dr. David L. Mills, now Professor Emeritus at the University
of Delaware.  Dr. Mills was also the original architect of the
original reference implementation, now called "NTP Classic", that the
NTP Security Project is updating.

Development of NTPsec is currently being funded by the Linux
Foundation's Core Infrastructure Initiative, which was formed in the
wake of the "Heartbleed Bug".
