This is the directory of document masters which, when published, becomes
the ntpsec website.

Edit cycle:

1. Modify the asciidoc.

2. Run 'rebuild' to generate HTML from the masters.

3. Commit everything, then push.

The github.io site ignores the .txt files and makes the HTML visible.

The HTML is normally write-locked to remind you not to modify it.
