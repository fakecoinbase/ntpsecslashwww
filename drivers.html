<h2 id="_summary">Summary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>ntpd contains support for 42 driver types.  Of these: 2 are IPC drivers
which must be retained; 10 are for hardware that might, under very
generous assumptions, still be of use; and 30 can be discarded.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Out of that 10, the actual utility of some remains dubious, but the
cultural/political context of the project probably requires that we
retain them.  I discuss related issues in a concluding section.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_technological_context">Technological context</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>NTP&#8217;s driver inventory contains several different classes of precision
time sources.  The software is now around 40 years old, and some of
those classes are now obsolescent or semi-obsolescent.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>See <a href="http://www.catb.org/gpsd/time-service-intro.html">Introduction to
Time Service</a>" for terminology, device classes, and accuracy.  The
summary version is that inexpensive 1PPS-capable GPS devices have a
nearly overwhelming cost-effectivenee advantage over older time source
types, and the utility of supporting those older types is accordingly
plummeting.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I think it is actually seriously questionable whether support for
<strong>any</strong> of these legacy devices is worth maintaining.  No hardware
drivers have been added since 2006, and possibly none since 2002.
NIST&#8217;s modulation change in 2013 laid waste to the U.S. time-radio
industry. It may actually be the case that <strong>all</strong> the Stratum 1 sites
running non-custom ntpd instances are using GPSes now.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, political reality - especially for a federally-funded project
with customers in a lot of .gov and .mil shops running very old iron -
does not necessarily allow the best technical move, which would be to
drop all the drivers, see who screams, and reinstate the fewest we
can.  I will return to this issue.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_objectives_and_criteria">Objectives and criteria</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Two of our main objectives in the ntpd resue are (1) to eliminate security
vulnerabilities and (2) move the code to a maintainable state.  An
effective way of accomplishing both would be to outright remove as
much code as possible from ntpd.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>ntpd includes no fewer than 46 device drivers for local clock sources.
Some effective means of removing code would be to remove drivers which
are obsolescent by the following criteria:</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
INTRINSIC
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        Remove hardware that can no longer work for intrinsic technical reasons.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
DEPRECATED
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        Remove deprecated drivers - that is, drivers which the ntpd
        documentation itself declares obsolete or no longer documents.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
DISCONTINUED
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        Remove drivers for products that have been discontinued for
        more than seven years. (In the first version of this report
        the proposal was ten years.  Please see the final section
        on policy and conclusions.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
UNAVAILABLE
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        Remove drivers for products which cannot be found for sale
        with a web search. (I have noted when remaindered units are
        available on e-Bay and second-hand sites.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
REDUNDANT
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        Remove drivers that duplicate capabilities better provided by
        GPSD (or, in principle, other sensor managers).
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
INACCURATE
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        Remove GPS drivers and time radios for which the hardware offers no
        better source accuracy than a timing GPS available for less than
        $75 in 2015; that is, about 5&micro;s.  (However, do not necessarily
        remove poorer-performing GPS-conditioned <strong>clocks</strong>, as they continue
        to supply time in holdover mode when the GPS cannot get satellite lock.)
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We should certainly keep drivers such as SHM and GPSD-NG that are IPC
methods for peer time-source programs in ntpd itself.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_first_round_triage">First-round triage</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The following lists the drivers in ntpd4, categorizes them, and
recommends a disposition for each. It&#8217;s based on the master list
from the NTP Classic documentation.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Types 15, 23, 24, and 25 are not listed because they are reserved and
not in use.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_type_1_undisciplined_local_clock">Type 1: Undisciplined Local Clock</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This driver type is described as deprecated.  It is in any case
obsolete anywhere with a sky view, where a GPS will do a better job.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Disposition: Fails tests DEPRECATED and INACCURATE; Remove.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_type_2_trak_8820_gps_receiver">Type 2:   Trak 8820 GPS Receiver</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This driver still existed only as one mention in the ntp4
documentation.  There is no refclock implementation for it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Web searches reach one copy of the technical manual dating from 1994
and preserved here:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="http://www.to-way.com/tf/trak8820a.pdf">http://www.to-way.com/tf/trak8820a.pdf</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>All other references are to copies of old ntpd documentation. I
conclude that this hardware is extremely obsolete and
discontinued well before before 2000.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Disposition: Fails tests DEPRECATED, DISCONTINUED, UNAVAILABLE; Remove.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_type_3_psti_traconex_1020_wwv_wwvh_receiver_wwv_pst">Type 3: PSTI/Traconex 1020 WWV/WWVH Receiver (WWV_PST)</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This device is described here: link://prc68.com/I/PST1020.shtml with a
2005 note that it is "not very reliable" having drifted by a full minute.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Investigating the vendor site at U.S. Traffic Corp (now Peek Traffic)
reveals that this device was discontinued, probably before 2000.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>According to this August 2001 post</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.protocols.time.ntp/0jOItglBTLE">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.protocols.time.ntp/0jOItglBTLE</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>the device required manual intervention every year and was not
designed for use after 2001.  Dave Mills replied to that one in a way
that implies he still has two of these and there is a workaround to
the problem described, but also says they have a service life of only
a few years due to a failure-prone component.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I could not find any for sale on the Web.  This hardware
would no longer work even if a specimen could be found, due to WWVB&#8217;s
modulation change as described in the next entry.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Disposition: Fails tests INTRINSIC, DISCONTINUED, UNAVAILABLE, and
INACCURATE; Remove.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_type_4_spectracom_wwvb_gps_receivers_wwvb_spec">Type 4: Spectracom WWVB/GPS Receivers (WWVB_SPEC)</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since WWVB changed its modulation scheme in January 2013
Spectracom WWVB receivers from before that date no longer function.
The models covered by this driver (Model 8170, Netclock/2 WWVB) are in
this category.  Spectracom has not produced any new time-radio gear
since the modulation change.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, the Spectracom 9300 (still in production and support)
is a GPS clock that can emit the type 0 and 2 formats recognized
by this driver.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Disposition: Move to refclockd.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_type_5_truetime_gps_goes_omega_receivers_truetime">Type 5: TrueTime GPS/GOES/OMEGA Receivers (TRUETIME) ==</h3>

I can find is from 1997:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA324042</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The devices can be found for sale, but only on e-Bay and electronics
remainder sites.  The vendor seems to be long gone.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Disposition: DISCONTINUED; Remove.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_type_6_irig_audio_decoder_irig_audio">Type 6: IRIG Audio Decoder (IRIG_AUDIO)</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This driver is a very, very bad idea given flesh. It demodulates an
<strong>audio signal</strong> emitted by several radio time sources, requiring custom
wiring to connect to a microphone or line-in port.  All for
accuracy two orders of magnitude worse (500&micro;s) than a cheap 1PPS GPS
and no holdover capability.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Disposition: INACCURATE; Remove.</p></div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_type_7_radio_chu_audio_demodulator_decoder_chu">Type 7: Radio CHU Audio Demodulator/Decoder (CHU)</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A very bad idea similarly wired to Type 6, using a Canadian analog
of WWVB.  Cited as 1ms accuracy without GPS calibration.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Disposition: INACCURATE; Remove.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_type_8_generic_reference_driver_parse">Type 8: Generic Reference Driver (PARSE)</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is a driver supporting a large variety of time radios, some of
which (such as the Meinberg line) are still generally available.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A line of GPSes produced by Magnavox, discontinued in 1994, with
the surplus stock marketed by Leica Geosystems.  Leica no longer
sells them.  They shipped 1PPS.  I could find none available for sale.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Disposition: DISCONTINUED, UNAVAILABLE; Remove.</p></div>

<h3 id="_type_10_austron_2200a_2201a_gps_receivers_gps_as2201">Type 10: Austron 2200A/2201A GPS Receivers (GPS_AS2201)</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>An obsolete line of 1PPS GPS receivers.  Austron was acquired some
time before 1996 and the product line apparently discontinued then.
A few units were still in hobbyist use in 2006, but there don&#8217;t
seem to be more recent references even on the time-nuts list.

<div class="paragraph"><p>An obsolete clock source that connected directly to the SBus of a Sun
workstation. SBus was replaced rapidly by PCI after 1997; no hardware
based on SBus has been shipped for at least a decade and the last
of these were probably shipped before the year 2000. I could find

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The 1.0 version of this document contained a technical policy proposal
but no conclusions.  It was, essentially, to remove all drivers tagged
INTRINSIC, DEPRECATED, OBSOLETE, REDUNDANT, and INACCURATE, but
allow for reinstatement of merely OBSOLETE drivers on demonstration of
a real-world use case.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>At that time the proposed obsolescence timeout was ten years.  I noted
that there is only one driver for hardware that has been discontinued,
but possibly too recently - Type 35; the date it was end-of-lifed is
unclear.  I have continued to designate it OBSOLETE, as its reliance
on a parallel port means it is extremely likely to have been
discontinued before 2008.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Susan Sons, acting as program manager, changed the timeout to seven
years.  She endorsed the exception that obsolete drivers may be
reinstated if and when specific users demonstrate a need for them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To date, there has been one such reinstatement: the Hewlett Packard
58503A (type 26), requested by Hal Murray.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Accordingly, the list under "Potentially viable drivers" is the list
to be retained in the cleanup release of NTP.  This list may be
revised as we receive new information.</p></div>

Dave Mills might have these two, but I have no idea if they're up and
running and there's no good way to access them at his place.  If they
are up and running I might be able to get logs for you.

&gt; |Type 42: Zyfer GPStarplus Receiver

I had one of these back when I wrote the driver, but I haven't seen one
since.  There is no maintainer for this refclock, so if a problem is
found with it I'll ping the manufacturer and either they'll fix it or
I'll deprecate the driver.  I wrote this driver because Zyfer had a
customer (the NSA) who asked for it.  I haven't heard a word about this</pre>
