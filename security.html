<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>We specifically invite and welcome the scrutiny and participation of
responsible security researchers.  Please, inspect the code, abuse the
APIs, fuzz the sockets, and attack the network traffic.</p></div>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Please report discovered vulnerabiltites to mailto:security@ntpsec.org.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This email alias forwards to a very small cadre of the internal NTPsec
team.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You may GPG encrypt your report. The GPG key can be found on the well
known keyservers, and has the following id and fingerprint:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Our goal is to ack receipt within 24 hours, verify each potential
vulnerability within 3 days, and if the vulnerability is a significant
network risk, such as remote execution, denial of service, network
amplification, or corruption of time reporting, develop a fix within 7
days.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Our experience so far is that we are much faster than that.</p></div>

<h2 id="_reporter_responsible_disclosure_policies">Reporter Responsible Disclosure Policies</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>We honor responsible disclosure policies and embargos requested by
responsible security researchers and security research organizations.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Vulnerabilities properly reported to us are tracked in a controlled
access issue tracker.  Development of fixes is done in private Git
repos. Issues and fixes will opened to the public when the reasonable
embargo expires.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If we receive vulnerability reports that are duplicates, we will put
the reporters in contact with each other, and then will honor the
shortest embargo.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_our_responsible_disclosure_policies">Our Responsible Disclosure Policies</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>As NTPsec is currently in developer pre-release and is not yet
deployed in production, we current have no responsible disclosure or
embargo policies of our own.  As we find issues and vulnerabilities
ourselves and by regular contributors, we will verify and fix on our
existing development and release cadence, in our public issue tracker
and on our public Git repositories.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once NTPsec is in production use on the public internet or by
significant users in their own datacenters, we will work towards an
industry standard best practices Responsible Disclosure and Embargo
Policy.</p></div>
