NTPsec builds cleanly on at least the following systems:

* Fedora 23 and 24 (i686, x86_64)
* CentOS 7.2.1511 and 6.8 (x86_64)
* Debian jessie (amd64, i686, arm) and wheezy on amd64
* Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS and 16.04.1 LTS on x86_64
* Raspbian jessie on ARM v6 and v7 (Pi, Pi 2, and Pi 3)
* Debian wheezy on BeagleBone Black ARM v7
* FreeBSD 10.2 and 9.3 on amd64 and 10.3 on i386
* NetBSD 7.0.1 on x86_64 and 7.0.1 on i386
* macOS 10.12 on x86_64

Some of these systems have minor build quirks; see the INSTALL file
in the distribution root directory for details

Normal time sync in client mode works correctly on all the listed
systems.  Server mode has been well tested under Debian and Raspbian,
less so on other variants and *BSD.

However, platform dependencies other than adjtime(2) and adjtimex(2)
are minimal.  Experience with the codebase suggests it will run
correctly anywhere it builds correctly.

The following refclocks are known to work under Linux:

|===========================================================
| 20 |  NMEA GPS Receiver
| 22 |  PPS Clock Discipline
| 26 |  Hewlett Packard 58503A GPS Receiver
| 28 |  Shared Memory Driver
| 29 |  Trimble Navigation Palisade GPS (with Thunderbolt)
| 46 |  GPSD NG client protocol
|===========================================================

The best-tested refclock on non-Linux systems is SHM,
especially in combination with GPSD.
