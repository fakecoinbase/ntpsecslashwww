<div class="paragraph"><p>We encourage community involvement.  Here are some of the ways you can
contribute:</p></div>

</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_report_bugs_and_send_patches">Report bugs and send patches</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Open-source code review is the heart of our process. We welcome bug
reports and fix patches. We&#8217;ll be happy to work with casual contributors,
casual contributors who want to become regulars, and regulars who aspire
to join the core team.</p></div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_sign_up_as_a_platform_maintainer">Sign up as a platform maintainer</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The core team can&#8217;t be everywhere, nor can we cover every operating
system and hardware platform collaboration.  If the POSIX/C99 build
breaks in your special environment, consider working with us as
a platform maintainer.</p></div>

<h2 id="_donate_to_support_the_project">Donate to support the project</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>NTP is critical infrastructure that has fallen into disrepair.
There&#8217;s a lot of work that needs to be done on it.  The core
team has the skills and experience to get the job done, but
it&#8217;s going to take many person-years of concentrated attention
to get it done - beyond the limit of what unpaid voluntarism
can sustain.  Also, some of the test hardware we need is
specialized and expensive.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Accurate time is the beating pulse of the Internetted world economy.
If you are a business or government agency or wealthy individual that
relies on the Internet, you rely on NTP.  We accept tax-deductible
donations through the <a href="//icei.org">Internet Civil Engineering
Institute</a>.  Please give generously - the civilization you
save may be your own.</p></div>
