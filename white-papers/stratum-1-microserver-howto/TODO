* Collect fudges for u-blox 6, u-blox 8, MTK3339.

* Write a description of how to derive a fudge from observation (does
  GPSD HOWTO have this?)

* Can we make an ntp.conf that is really autonomous for operation off
  the public net?  If so, that's what we need in our ntp.conf, with
  adding check servers as an optional extra.
