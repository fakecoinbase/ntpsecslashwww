# If you are already familar with ntpd and wonder why this recipe uses
# gpsd rather than ntpd's native refclock 20 GPS driver, the answer is
# this: when refclock 20 is configured to use 1PPS, it mixes in-band
# time data with 1PPS in a way that causes it to behave badly, and
# possibly get rejected as a falseticker, when 1PPS is only occasionally
# available.)
