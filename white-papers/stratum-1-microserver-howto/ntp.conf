# Known Stratum 1 servers with excellent quality and connectivity.
# We list these because the sync algoritms in ntpd wants at least
# three good chimers, and taking time from these is backup if the
# GPS loses lock for an extended period of time.
#
# For better performance, find some Stratum 1 servers nearer you -
# that is, with a shorter ping time.  Best not to use servers from
# the public pools, as you could be randomly assigned one on the
# other side of the world.
