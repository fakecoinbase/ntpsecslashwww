<h2 id="_why_ntpsec">Why NTPsec?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>NTPsec was forked from NTP Classic 4.3.34 in early 2015 after many
installations of NTP Classic were repeatedly exploited as amplifiers
in distributed denial-of-service attacks.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This failure didn&#8217;t happen at random. NTP Classic has long neglected
open-source best practices, and stagnated as a result. The code needed
to be fixed, and the development practice around it reformed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can read more about <a href="history.html">How NTPsec came to be</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_should_we_believe_your_security_reliability_claims">Why should we believe your security/reliability claims?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The NTPsec team combines the expertise of senior developers from
NTP Classic, the <a href="//www.catb.org/~esr/GPSD">GPSD project</a>, and the
<a href="https://www.rtems.org/">RTEMS Project</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>GPSD has an exceptional record of reliability and security over a
decade of literally billions of deployments in mobile and embedded
systems ranging from smartphones through life-critical navigation
systems to military and aerospace applications.  You rely on it every
time you use Google Maps.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>RTEMS is the real-time operating system used in deep-space missions.
It is ultra-reliable because it has to be; there&#8217;s no on-site
tech support a million miles from Earth.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Applying that GPSD and RTEMS experience to NTP combines the best in
modern high-reliability software engineering with the proven
excellence of the NTP Classic core algorithms.</p></div>
