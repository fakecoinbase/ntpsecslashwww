= Platform support policy =

Our primary development platforms are Linux and FreeBSD.

We expect the NTPsec code to run with at most minor port changes on
Unixlike operating systems conforming to POSIX.1-2001 and ISO/IEC
9899:1999 (aka C99). and supporting ntp_gettime(2)/ntp_adjtime(2).
Python 2.5 is also required.  We will fully support these platforms.

We intend to port to Windows, but that may not land in early releases.

Hardware with 32 or 64 bits and any endianness is supported.

NTP Classic kept legacy support for a lot of very ancient Unix big
iron, and for other systems such as Microsoft Windows and VMS.  But
increasing security requires reducing complexity and attack surface.
Our project direction is towards dropping legacy support (and unused
or rarely-used features) in order to achieve secure simplicity.

If you are a stranded legacy user with security and reliability
requirements strong enough that only NTPsec will do, our team is open
to working with active port maintainers who will take responsibility
for specific target environments not fully conformant to the
POSIX.1-2001/C99/Python-2.5 combination, or for exotic hardware.
