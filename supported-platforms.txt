= Platform support policy =

The 1.x legacy branch will support whatever NTP Classic supported. The
core team won't be doing new porting work on 1.x.  If your build
breaks, you need to move to 2.x.

Out of the box, the 2.x branch will be fully supported on Unixlike
operating systems conforming to POSIX.1-2001 and ISO/IEC 9899:1999
(aka C99).  Python 2.5 is also required.  This includes all current
Linux and *BSD operating systems.

Hardware with 32 or 64 bits and any endianness is supported.

NTP Classic kept legacy support for a lot of very ancient Unix big
iron, and for other systems such as Microsoft Windows and VMS.  But
increasing security requires reducing complexity and attack surface.
Our project direction is towards dropping legacy support (and unused
or rarely-used features) in order to achieve secure simplicity.

If you are a stranded legacy user with security and reliability
requirements strong enough that only NTPsec will do, our team is open
to working with active port maintainers who will take responsibility
for specific target environments not fully conformant to the
POSIX.1-2001/C99/Python-2.5 combination, or for exotic hardware.
