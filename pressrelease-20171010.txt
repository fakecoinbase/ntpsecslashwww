= NTP Security Project announces 1.0 release =

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 2017-10-10

Today, the NTPsec Project announced the 1.0 release of NTPsec.

NTPsec is an implementation of the “Network Time Protocol” or
“NTP”. NTP is how the internet keeps correct time, which is critically
important for cybersecurity and for auditing, and is necessary for
online finance, cloud computing, media streaming, data storage, email,
calendaring, and for keeping the clock on your desktop set.

NTPsec is based on the original reference implementation created by
Dr. David L. Mills, now Professor Emeritus at the University of
Delaware and one of the original creators of the Internet itself.

As a “first production release”, NTPsec 1.0 is offered to open source
developers and to government, corporate, and academic internet and
compute infrastructure, to provide local and network remote time
synchronization via the standard NTPv4 protocol.

The goal of the project is to harden against security vulnerabilities
and especially against “amplification attacks” that threaten the
stability of the entire Internet.  The project welcomes the
participation of information security researchers, and practices
Responsible Disclosure.

The project uses modern open source community development practice,
including the Git distributed version control, permissive open source
licensing, and a community centric development model, where all
contributors are welcome.
