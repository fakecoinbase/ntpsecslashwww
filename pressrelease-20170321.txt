= NTPsec Project announces 0.9.7, with assistance from Mozilla Secure Open Source (SOS) initiative

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 2017-03-21

Today, the NTPsec Project announced the 0.9.7 release of NTPsec, with
assistance from the Mozilla Foundation's "Secure Open Source"
initiative.

NTPsec is an implementation of the “Network Time Protocol” or
“NTP”. NTP is how the internet keeps correct time, which is critically
important for cybersecurity and for auditing, and is necessary for
online finance, cloud computing, media streaming, data storage, email,
calendaring, and for keeping the clock on your desktop set.

NTPsec 0.9.7 is offered to open source developers and to government,
corporate, and academic IT labs for feedback and code contributions.
The project uses modern open source community development practice,
including Git distributed version control and permissive open source
licensing.  Development is driving to a production-ready 1.0 release,
and beyond.

NTPsec 0.9.7 incorporates significant improvements in security,
accuracy, precision, visualization, and usability, with assistance,
contributions, and audits provided by infosec researchers and other
technical contributors.

For this release, the NTPsec Project worked particularly closely with
the Mozilla Foundation's "Secure Open Source" initiative, who funded
an infosec audit, and with Cure53, who provided the audit.
